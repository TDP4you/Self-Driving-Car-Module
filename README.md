# Self Driving Car Simulation

This is Demo Video of Self Driving Car Module that I have implemented during my Artificial Intelligence Course. 

I have used Artificial Neural Network for designing this. It has 5 nodes in input layer and 3 nodes in output node. ANN is implemented using one hidden layer with 60 nodes.

There are 3 files:

1. map.py - This is the main file to run the code. 
2. ai.py - This is brain of simulation i.e. ANN is implemented in this file. 
3. car.kv - This file contains design information for the car.
